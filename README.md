## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22+
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for bundling

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jswears/supply-chain-optimizer-backend.git
cd supply-chain-optimizer-backend
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your config values
```

### Build the Project

```bash
npx tsx esbuild.config.ts
```

This compiles TypeScript, bundles Lambda functions, and outputs to `infrastructure/build/`.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

ChainOpt is built for AWS. Two deployment options are supported:

### 1. Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export ENVIRONMENT=dev
export REGION=eu-central-1
export S3_BUCKET=chainopt-cf-artifacts

# Run the deploy script
cd infrastructure/scripts
./deploy-script.sh
```

Use the interactive menu to deploy all or selected services.

### 2. Manual Deployment

Manually deploy the stack in this order:

1. Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
2. IAM roles
3. DynamoDB tables
4. RDS (PostgreSQL)
5. Lambda functions
6. API Gateway setup

See the [Deployment Guide](./infrastructure/templates/deployment-guide.md) for full steps.
